<b> <h3> Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models</b> </h3>

[Click Here to follow the progress!](https://github.com/rxdhikx/Large-Language-Model)

<h4> Tech: LLMs, Transformers, Pytorch, NLP, Remote Server, Virtual Environment, Git </h4>

<h3> Objectives: </h3>
 - Collection of relevant datasets from various sources to work on more than 200,000 samples. <br>
 - Construction of a robust discriminator to detect hallucinations in LLM's generated response, by reviewing the performance of different PLM's and training it, to minimize the cross-entropy loss function. <br>
 - Utilization of transformers, pytorch and accelerate using 72b training models like Llama2 and MoMo - which is #3 on the open LLM leaderboard. (as of 02/20/2024) <br>
 - Analysis on different types of hallucinations with LLM-assessment metrics, machine, human and composite metrics. <br>
