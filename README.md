<h2>üì∫ Ongoing Projects: </h2>

<b>Pixel to Plate: Recipe Generation Using Image Detection </b> <br>
[Click Here to follow the progress!](https://github.com/saitejasri1/Shared-ML-project)

<h4> Tech: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Computer Vision, App Development </h4>

<h4> Project Idea: </h4>

- Scrape recipes and cooking-related content.
- Apply NLP to understand and categorize recipes.
- Utilize OpenCV for image analysis of ingredients and finished dishes.
- Implement a deep learning model to recommend recipes based on user preferences and available ingredients.
- Develop a web application that provides an interactive and visually appealing recipe recommendation system.

<h2>üî≠ Ongoing Research: </h2>

<b>Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models</b> <br>
[Click Here to follow the progress!](https://github.com/rxdhikx/Large-Language-Model)

<h4> Tech: LLMs, Transformers, Pytorch, NLP, Remote Server, Virtual Environment, Git </h4>

<h3> Objectives: </h3>
 - Collection of relevant datasets from various sources to work on more than 200,000 samples.
 - Construction of a robust discriminator to detect hallucinations in LLM's generated response, by reviewing the performance of different PLM's and training it, to minimize the cross-entropy loss function.
 - Utilization of transformers, pytorch and accelerate using 72b training models like Llama2 and MoMo - which is #3 on the open LLM leaderboard. (as of 02/20/2024)
 - Analysis on different types of hallucinations with LLM-assessment metrics, machine, human and composite metrics.
